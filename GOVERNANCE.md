# Seedcase Project Governance

Decisions are made by following these steps:

1. Anyone can create a "decision post" and submit a Pull request of it describing an issue and a potential decision to make. These decision posts need to contain the following details on the issue, which is described in more detail in the [Community Guide entry on Making Decisions](https://community.seedcase-project.org/guides/making-decisions.html):

    - Context and Problem Statement
    - Decision Drivers
    - Considered Options
    - Decision Outcome
    - Consequences

2. The decision post is reviewed and discussed by the team. The team gives feedback and the post is either edited or accepted.

3. Disagreements will try to be resolved as much as possible but ultimately the final decision is made by the team leader.

The team leader assumes all accountability and responsibility for the decisions made.
